# Rise Guys
This is an AmazingRace-inspired Doodle Jump clone I started in 2012, continued in 2020, but never finished.

I made it in Macromedia Flash 8 and ActionScript 2, which has been discontinued. (rest in peace flash!)

So, if you want to play this game, I recommend you install the "Newgrounds Player" (https://www.newgrounds.com/flash/player) and use it to open Jump!.swf. Then you can enjoy your very own jellyfish-jumping game!

Note: If you want to restart a new game, I think you have to literally close Newgrounds Player, restart it, and select the .swf again.

Also: I noticed that about 30% of the games result in an "impossible jump". This is where two consecutive platforms are too far apart horizontally for the AI jellyfish to make. When this happens, the entire game stalls. Why? Well, if, say, 3 jellyfish are stuck on Leg 8 trying to get past an impossible jump, the jellyfish further along will be able to access Leg 9, but Leg 10 will not be "unlocked" to them until those 3 jellyfish either finish Leg 8 or are eliminated. (This is because confusing glitches can occur when jellyfish span 3+ legs at once.) They will never be eliminated, so, unfortunately, when these "impossible jumps" occur, the game is essentially unfinishable. It's really a shame that this occurs so often, and if there were one bug I could fix about this game, it would be that.
