# Rise Guys
This is an AmazingRace-inspired Doodle Jump clone I started in 2012, continued in 2020, but never finished.

I made it in Macromedia Flash 8 and ActionScript 2, which has been discontinued. (rest in peace flash!)

So, if you want to play this game, I recommend you install the "Newgrounds Player" (https://www.newgrounds.com/flash/player) and use it to open Jump!.swf. Then you can enjoy your very own jellyfish-jumping game!
